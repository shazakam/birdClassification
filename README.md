# Bird Classification via Transferlearning
Small Project to learn a bit more about TorchVision and Pre-trained models using the 525 Bird Classifcation Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species/code). 
The notebook and associated files are meant to be run in Google Colab.

Currently only using ResNet18 but would be fun to try other pre-trained models and changing the interior layers instead of just the output layer to see if results could be improved. ResNet34 already performs very well by itself so it would be fun to try to improve a pre-trained model which performs less optimally.

A couple of TODO:
- Show inference case with input image and associated predicted class!
  - One Succesful case
  -  Find Failure Prediction
-  Calculate accuracy and recall for model
-  Plot Training and Validation Loss :)
